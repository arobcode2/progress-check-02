#Progress Check 2 This is a prompt I completed as a student at hackreactor.
## Progress Check 2
- [x] Fork and clone this repo
- [x] Write a working implementation of _.min in `min.js`
- [x] Push your work to your fork

## _.min
`_.min(list, [iteratee])`

Returns the minimum value in **list**. If an **iteratee** function is provided, it will be used on each value to generate the criterion by which the value is ranked. _Infinity_ is returned if list is empty. Non-numerical values in **list** will be ignored.

```javascript
var numbers = [10, 5, 100, 2, 1000];
_.min(numbers) // returns 2
```
